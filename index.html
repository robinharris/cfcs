                The shop received the Queen's Award for Volunteering in 2022 - the highest level of recognition for voluntary organisations.
                Jo Ropner, the Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire, presented the glass crystal, now proudly displayed in the shop, at a ceremony accompanied by a special cake. Around 60 volunteers toasted the honour and then enjoyed a takeaway supper.</p>
