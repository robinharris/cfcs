            We are proud to operate entirely with volunteers - no-one takes any payment for their work.  The shop
            is highly professional and always aims to achieve best-practice.  We pay keen attention to minimising our impact on the environment; promoting
            recycling and minimising single use packaging.  
        </p>
        <p>Our volunteers are the shop</p>
        <p>
           There are opportunties to volunteer in several roles - your choice and no commitment.   There is a weekly rota
           to sign up for any shifts you fancy (mostly 2 hours).

        <p>Our team of volunteers is is a self-help group and frequently brings together
          people who would not otherwise meet each other.  Social events are organised regularly
          including Christmas parties, summer fayres and anytime there is something to celebrate.
          The work is fun, satisfying and enjoying time to relax with friends is so rewarding</p>

        <p>Most training is done on the job, working with an experienced volunteer.</p>
        <p>The till uses a simple touch screen and most items are scanned for pricing.</p>
        <p>Specific training is provided as appropriate</p>
        <p>A few topics need to be covered to meet regulations e.g. selling cigarettes and alcohol.  A short training session will be provided on one of your shifts</p>
