            We are proud to operate entirely with volunteers - no-one takes any payment for their work.  The shop
            is highly professional and always aims to achieve best-practice.  We pay keen attention to minimising our impact on the environment; promoting
            recycling and minimising single use packaging.  
        </p>

            Our volunteers are the shop.

           There are opportunties to volunteer in several roles - your choice and no commitment.   There is a weekly rota
           to sign up for any shifts you fancy (mostly 2 hours).

        <p>Most training is done on the job, working with an experienced volunteer.</p>
        <p>The till uses a simple touch screen and most items are scanned for pricing.</p>
        <p>Specific training is provided as appropriate</p>
        <p>A few topics need to be covered to meet regulations e.g. selling cigarettes and alcohol.  A short training session will be provided on one of yourt shifts</p>
